The group makes its way through the crypts, the worst has occurred as they find that only way forward is the way that happens to take them further into the depths of the forsaken architecture that they currently traverse. The sounds of those unfortunate enough to reawaken from their eternal slumber gradually increase but with the only way forward seemingly as dangerous as the corridor they just came from, they have no choice but to continue their arduous journey.

Unbeknown to the band of misfit adventurers, or overlooked by their hubris, is that the undead have no need for and know no rest. Their current state of being fueled by a relentless need to pursue and kill all those who trespass on their domain. They very rapidly approach the group as they reach the precipice of an abyss. A strange natural formation deep within the lower floors of the structure. The members of the trope continue to walk down the narrow corridors until they very suddenly open into a larger area where the seemingly bottomless pit separates them from their current location and that of progress along with continued survival.

One member explores their surroundings and finds a lever on one of the walls. In an act of extreme bravery or tremendous stupidity they decide to pull it. A sudden rumbling can be heard and stone bridge forms itself directly in front of the lever it’s a clear way to traverse to the other side of the chasm. The lever puller lets the lever go and the bridge deconstructs itself just as quickly as it appeared. To cross the bridge the group must leave a team member behind. It’s unclear whether there’s any other way across and its certain that the person that stays behind won’t have much time until they’re surrounded by undead monsters.

Leave someone behind so that the others may survive.

Refuse to possibly sacrifice a team member and try to find a different solution.

Suddenly the group hears a scream, its comes from directly in front of them and due to the nature of their current predicament and the way sound traverses space they have no way of knowing how far the scream is from their current location. Without any other options the group makes haste to locate the source of the sound. They run through the tunnels when they’re allowed to, occasionally crouching and vaulting over debris. The sounds of a skirmish quickly come to forefront of the team’s attention and they double their attempts to reach the ruckus as soon as they can.

The skirmish that they are soon to interact with is by no means a humble bar fight of half a dozen drunkards but instead something far worse. From what the group, can discern the battle ahead of them consists of two factions fighting against each other without any signs of compromise. One side is most obviously to the legion of corpses that walk around and infest the catacombs, telling from the scream the other side is clearly a different group of adventurers. 

The group gets closer and closer to the source of sounds; they draw weapon and ready themselves to fight. As they turn a corner they find themselves in a large room, on the other side they can clearly make out the battle. Dozens of undead surround a group of adventurers which seems equal in size to their own, they’re already overwhelmed and there’s little time left until they’re all dead. Joining the battle will most likely result in casualties as even with the efforts of the two groups the undead are far too many. Fortunately, there’s another option, one of your team spot a corridor leading out of one of the opposite walls.

Leave the group in danger and attempt to save yourselves by either turning back or heading sown the newly found route.

Join the battle in the hopes of saving the other group before it’s too late.

The adventurers continue their adventuring and soon enough reach a room that resembles a chapel, the stone work and ornamental nature of this location makes it stand out from the rest, members of the group seem uneasy. The chapels ornamental nature harpers clearly to some sort of religion, the only reason that it would be described as a chapel is that its organized as one would be. Stone benches are lined up parallel to a stage with an alter behind which stands a broken statue who’s only discernable feature is sculpted cloth. On top of the alter is a singular golden cup and apart from this highly suspicious piece of treasure there doesn’t seem to be anything else of interest in the room. 

A graverobber doesn’t mind this and immediately walks forward with the intention of pocketing the unprotected item. The other adventurers quickly decide to stop his recklessness and a cleric attempts to purify the cup while others try to locate any traps that could possibly surround it. 

It’s at this point that the cleric begins to behave erratically, they drop the purification spell mid cast and turn to another member speaking either in tongues or in an undiscernible language. The cleric leaps and begins to strangle another adventurer, the others unaware of a proper way to react go with the first instinct of separating the two. The clerics strength is extraordinary and its extremely unlikely that they’ll manage to separate the them before the strangled dies.

Save the person that’s about to die by killing the cleric.

Continue to attempt to separate the two sacrificing the person being strangled.

The adventure continues and as the brave or foolish people on this expedition continue further into the realm of the undead they hear a cackle. So far the only sounds that weren’t insufferable rattling of bones have originated from the living, based on the assumption that this trend would likely continue and obviously forgetting that they’ve travelled to deep for anybody to casually stroll into these structures, they decide to at least attempt to find the origin of the sound. As they turn into the location a person shouts telling them to stop. It’s too late some members are instantly turned into stone.

The person in the room seems to know why and how they were turned to stone unfortunately, they refuse to talk or say anything else. It is possible that the adventurers that were turned to stone may die. The adventurers can’t make him divulge what happened and the person remains silent. In exasperation and not knowing what else to do, some adventurers suggest torture. The petrified condition may or may not be reversible and there is no way of knowing what caused it. 
^
Torture the unknown person.

Don’t torture the unknown person.

Regardless of previous decisions the adventurer’s travel deeper in search of treasure and the source of the undead scourge. The only sounds that they can hear are that of their own footsteps all seems far more tranquil in these parts of the catacombs and the group even considers resting for a moment to eat and recuperate from past endeavors. They begin to search for a suitable location and find an indiscrete chamber with only the one exit and entrance, they enter and as they begin to look around a trap is sprung and 6 people are struck by arrows and gravely wounded.

Amongst the participants of the expedition is a very skilled cleric and it just so happens that the cleric is skilled in transfer of life and manages to stop the bleeding. Unfortunately, the adventurers are still extremely weak. Of the six gravely wounded if one were to hand their life over to the others it would ease their pain and save their lives. Taking the one person’s life force will kill them and help the others, not doing so means that the group now has wounded to attend to, carry and in the case of a battle defend, an extremely dangerous situation to be in.

Kill no one and carry on with the burden of the tending to the wounded.

This time the group finds itself in a dire situation they stumbled into a room filled with undead skeletons whose slumber was disturbed by their presence. A battle began and the situation quickly became confusing and difficult to manage. The adventurers did what they could and everyone fought valiantly. A fitting battle for people mad enough to venture into the dark depths of the world. Although many were injured only two wizards were gravely wounded in the battle. Amidst the confusion the group was surrounded and the benefits of long range magic greatly decrease in close quarter combat.

A cleric in the group possesses great ability and had the wounds been attended to sooner the possibility of saving both would have been possible, sadly this is no longer the case. The cleric is forced to use the last healing item that the group has in their possession the problem rests on deciding who is worthy of living and who isn’t. During the battle one wizard did extremely well in his efforts to suppress the undead. Before the two wizards where surrounded the wizard played a pivotal role in protecting the clerics and backing up the front liners. However, he did so in exchange for someone’s life, the first wizard had an opportunity to save a someone but instead prioritized his role in battle. The second wizard is far less skilled than the first and it’s because of his failures and ineptitude that both wizards were killed but he died sacrificing his life attempting to save the first wizard.

The adventures carry on the trip down the catacombs having successfully desecrated and pillaged a few untouched mausoleums along the way to, possibly, mapping and finding the source of the undead uprising. Before setting out on the quest the group decided to split all winnings equally between them. So far everything seems fair and any possible winnings have been split equally with everyone being completely open with their findings and the distribution of wealth. The grave robbers have so far been responsible for appraising the clear majority of the items as they have the most experience with the matters that pertain to their profession and the items that they rob. 

After a while you notice that one of these individuals has stayed further behind the group than usual and you approach them to see if everything is fine. They seem healthy but slightly paranoid and you decide to walk behind them and keep an eye on their behavior from now on. After a while of deep distrust you notice a shiny glimmer emanating from the adventurer’s possessions. You interrogate them about their behavior and said object. Discovering that they have been less honest than you first thought or even dared to assume. The graverobber seems to be in possession of something that is extremely valuable in exchange for your silence he proposes to skew and future dividends in your favor and split some of the wealth acquired from the object.

The group slowly makes its way through the difficult architecture of the underground structure and they find themselves moving deeper underground. The path they currently find themselves progressing on leads further and further underground. The cramped hallways become smaller and tighter, with nowhere to go except forward they have no choice but to carry on. Suddenly you hear a scream of pain that echoes throughout the structure. Its quickly silenced and it seems to not have alerted any enemies to your location and you decide to walk to the front to find out what’s going on.

The cleric is suffering from a debilitating injury it seems that they have somehow managed to trap themselves by falling into a depression in the floor that has put her in constant and permanent pain and agony. The group attempts to remove them from the chasm only most likely make it worse. After a couple of hours in constant pain and incapable of finding a suitable remedy for the situation the cleric decided they want to die. However, the condition is such that it’s impossible to die without any assistance. The cleric begs and pleads with you to help commit suicide. The group is to far down and don’t have the time to return to find any sort of help, not that they would find more capable hands than theirs anyway. Leaving them alive in this predicament is a fate far worse than death.
