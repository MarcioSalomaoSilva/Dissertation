Please read the following scenario carefully and make a decision that best describes or reflects what you would do in a similar situation in a game.

The group sits around a hastily made fire barely large enough to project their shadows on the stone work behind them. As they stare gloomily into the fire everyone begins to take stock of the day’s events. It’s been almost a full day of exploration and although the grave robber managed to find a few well appraised items the party is almost running out of rations. It’s time to return to the surface, the only obstacles are the labyrinthian nature of the architecture and the undead that they either failed to find or kill on their voyage down. 

As the team of adventurers begins to eat some field rations the noises in background get louder in a way that clearly indicates that their proximity is steadily increasing. Seems like the leisurely picnic among the dead must wait. They quickly gather their things and put away any unfinished food. By the time they’ve finished and drawn swords, wands and staffs the undead skeletons and corpses reach the outside off their barricaded resting area. Your team of adventurers holds firm staring at the barricade, as it takes on the force of an unknown group of enemies. It’s clear from their current efforts that any chances for civilized discussion aren’t on the table. The barricade rattles from the force thrown at it, with each undead attempt to take it down the whole room shakes and dirt falls from the ceiling, further indication of how dire their current situation is. The inhuman efforts indicate that their foe is not only stronger but that they may also be greatly outnumbered. 

The barricade won’t hold for long the members of the group are all powerless to do anything except for the mage who recently learnt a powerful spell capable of creating an explosive force. He also possesses a few other minor spells capable of inflicting damage on an individual basis but won’t have as much power as the recently acquired explosive spell. If this problem wasn’t complicating the situation enough there’s another conundrum inducing caveat to the mages abilities, the need to wait for his magic power to charge and recharge after every use. You know that the mage has enough time to charge one explosive spell and the ability to charge up multiple smaller spells.

What should the mage do and how will his actions affect the following events and is fellow adventurers? On the one hand, he can play it safe, charge multiple smaller spells and trust that the others can defend themselves or you can choose for him to charge up the powerful explosive spell possibly defeating more foes and saving the others from harm.

The spell charges successfully and as the barricade collapses under the enemy incursion, the party mage uses his explosive magic and the stumbling corpses of the undead, too many to count, take a huge hit. A fireball erupts from the mages magical staff and the enemies in the frontline get immediately annihilated by the magical blast those lucky in enough to have been in the back rows or not in direct line of fire didn’t manage to escape. The enormous fireball hits the crypt wall opposite the mausoleum entrance flames once held together by the mages prowess disperse, incinerating the once alive but dead reanimated corpses of former inhabitants of Ornot. 

The rest of the party now on their backs and mildly cindered by the flames of the spell were completely unaware of were the eruptive force had emerged from. As they get back up and take stock of the situation the realize that the only person still standing and holding their magical weapon in an attack stance was the Mage. In awe at the immense magical prowess that was directed onto the enemies that were just moments ago ready to tear them apart. They gathered around the mage and congratulated the magic practitioner.

The mage charges multiple spells successfully and as the barricade collapses under the enemy incursion, the party mage uses his first fireball on an enemy skeleton. It immediately gets blown the fuck out, the party looks around nods and prepares for the fight that quickly ensues. They struggle with a few enemies luckily although they were outnumbered they weren’t outclassed. Each tackled the foes in their own way with their unique abilities and the mage did more than his share of the work, turns out that the impact from fireballs is ideal for the situation.

The encounter ends and the cleric that until now had mostly resorted to buffing allies was tending to everyone’s post combat wounds, everyone was tired but thankfully no one got badly wounded from the encounter. Everyone gathered around and started to chow down once more but this time slightly hungrier, the grave robber on the other hand was searching the self-exhumed for anything of value.
