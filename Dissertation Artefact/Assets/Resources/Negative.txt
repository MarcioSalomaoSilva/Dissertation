Please read the following scenario carefully and make a decision that best describes or reflects what you would do in a similar situation in a game.

The group sits around a hastily made fire barely large enough to project their shadows on the stone work behind them. As they stare gloomily into the fire everyone begins to take stock of the day’s events. It’s been almost a full day of exploration and although the grave robber managed to find a few well appraised items the party is almost running out of rations. It’s time to return to the surface, the only obstacles are the labyrinthian nature of the architecture and the undead that they either failed to find or kill on their voyage down. 

As the team of adventurers begins to eat some field rations the noises in background get louder in a way that clearly indicates that their proximity is steadily increasing. Seems like the leisurely picnic among the dead must wait. They quickly gather their things and put away any unfinished food. By the time they’ve finished and drawn swords, wands and staffs the undead skeletons and corpses reach the outside off their barricaded resting area. Your team of adventurers holds firm staring at the barricade, as it takes on the force of an unknown group of enemies. It’s clear from their current efforts that any chances for civilized discussion aren’t on the table. The barricade rattles from the force thrown at it, with each undead attempt to take it down the whole room shakes and dirt falls from the ceiling, further indication of how dire their current situation is. The inhuman efforts indicate that their foe is not only stronger but that they may also be greatly outnumbered. 

The barricade won’t hold for long the members of the group are all powerless to do anything except for the mage who recently learnt a powerful spell capable of creating an explosive force. He also possesses a few other minor spells capable of inflicting damage on an individual basis but won’t have as much power as the recently acquired explosive spell. If this problem wasn’t complicating the situation enough there’s another conundrum inducing caveat to the mages abilities, the need to wait for his magic power to charge and recharge after every use. You know that the mage has enough time to charge one explosive spell and the ability to charge up multiple smaller spells.

What should the mage do and how will his actions affect the following events and is fellow adventurers? On the one hand, he can play it safe, charge multiple smaller spells and trust that the others can defend themselves or you can choose for him to charge up the powerful explosive spell possibly defeating more foes and saving the others from harm.

The spell charges successfully and as the barricade collapses under the enemy incursion, the party mage uses his explosive magic and the stumbling corpses of the undead, too many to count, take a huge hit. A fireball erupts from the mages magical staff and the enemies in the frontline get immediately annihilated by the magical blast those lucky in enough to have been in the back rows or not in direct line of fire didn’t manage to escape. The enormous fireball hits the crypt wall opposite the mausoleum entrance flames once held together by the mages prowess disperse, and the walls begin to crumble and fall apart. 

The rest of the party now on their backs and mildly cindered by the flames of the spell were completely unaware of where the eruptive force had emerged from. They have no time to gather their thoughts the ceiling above them is collapsing. In shock from both the immense magical prowess that was directed onto the enemies and the falling roof they have no time to gather their loot. They quickly run down from the falling debris and until the structure stops caving in. They are all alive but without any resources or luxuries required for their continued survival.

The mage charges multiple spells successfully and as the barricade collapses under the enemy incursion, the party mage uses his first fireball on an enemy skeleton. Apart from burning away any remaining flesh and cloth and angering the undead further It had no effect, the party simultaneously turned to stare disapproving at the mage. They struggle with a few enemies luckily although they are outnumbered they aren’t outclassed. All apart from the mage tackled the foes in their own way with their unique abilities but the mages spells did little more than annoy the enemy, turns out that when facing these foes, fire wasn’t the most suitable weapon.

The encounter continues and the group is clearly outnumbered, tired but thankfully not yet fatally wounded from the encounter. They attempt a quick escape they quickly run down the one of the many corridors until they manage to outrun their foe. They’re all alive but without any resources or luxuries required for their continued survival.
